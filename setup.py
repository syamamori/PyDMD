    "Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a model reduction algorithm "
    "developed by Schmid (see 'Dynamic mode decomposition of numerical and "
    "experimental data').  Since then has emerged as a powerful tool for "
    "analyzing the dynamics of nonlinear systems. DMD relies only on the "
    "high-fidelity measurements, like experimental data and numerical "
    "simulations, so it is an equation-free algorithm. Its popularity is "
    "also due to the fact that it does not make any assumptions about the "
    "underlying system. See Kutz ('Dynamic Mode Decomposition: "
    "Data-Driven Modeling of Complex Systems') for a comprehensive "
    "overview of the algorithm and its connections to the Koopman-operator "
    "analysis, initiated in Koopman ('Hamiltonian systems and "
    "transformation in Hilbert space'), along with examples in "
    "computational fluid dynamics.\n"
    "\n"
    "In the last years many variants arose, such as multiresolution DMD, "
    "compressed DMD, forward backward DMD, and higher order DMD among "
    "others, in order to deal with noisy data, big dataset, or spurius "
    "data for example.\n"
    "\n"
    "In PyDMD we implemented the majority of the variants mentioned above "
    "with a user friendly interface.\n"
    "\n"
    "The research in the field is growing both in computational fluid "
    "dynamic and in structural mechanics, due to the equation-free nature "
    "of the model.\n"
